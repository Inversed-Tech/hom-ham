# Using Concrete compiler

This folder contains Python programs based on the Concrete library. A compiler is responsible for generating the underlying circuits.

To run the code, you must install the Concrete library, as described [here](https://docs.zama.ai/concrete/getting-started/installing). After installation, execute `python FILENAME`, where `FILENAME` corresponds to one of the files in this folder.
